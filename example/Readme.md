This directory contains the following examples:

1. ex_1_agau_309_Icosahedron
    * Uses the data of Larson Et Al, who investigated icosahedral Ag<sub>X</sub>Au<sub>309-X</sub> NPs (0 <= X <= 309)
    * Shows how to construct a bondlist
    * Shows how to generate an atomgraph object
    * Shows how to calculate the chemical ordering parameter 
2. ex_2_agcu_Icosahedrons
    * Shows how to perform database queries to search for existing particles in np.db
    * Shows how to construct an atomgraph using the database interface
    * Shows how to calculate excses energies using the built-in atomgraph method
