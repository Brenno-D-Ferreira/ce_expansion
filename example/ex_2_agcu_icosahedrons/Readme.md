# Excess Energies for 309-5083 atom Icosahedrons

This folder investigates the excess energies of Ag<sub>X</sub>Cu<sub>Y-X</Sub> (0 <= X <= Y and Y in {309, 561, 923, 1415, 2057, 2869, 5083})

In this example, we perform a database query for various copper-silver bimetallic nanoparticles in sizes ranging from 309-5083 atoms for all magic-numbered icosahedrons. We then demosntrate how to create an atomgraph object and calculate excess energy with it. Finally, a plot is produced using these results.
